# ReactNativeKit

ReactNativeKit is a native macOS debugger shell for React Native apps. It currently uses the Reactotron protocol packages as the runtime compatibility layer, kept in `packages/reactotron`.

## Requirements

- macOS 13 or newer
- Xcode command line tools
- Node.js 18 or newer
- Corepack enabled for Yarn

## First setup on a new machine

From the repository root:

```bash
npm run setup
npm run start
```

`swift run ReactNativeKit` starts the native macOS app. The app automatically starts the local ReactNativeKit backend, which listens for app events on runtime port `9091`, starts the local API on `3901`, and starts MCP on `4567`.

## Running again after setup

```bash
npm run start
```

If `packages/reactotron` changes, rebuild it before launching ReactNativeKit again:

```bash
npm run build:reactotron
```

## React Native app setup

Configure your React Native app to use runtime port `9091`.

```ts
Reactotron.configure({
  name: "YourApp",
  port: 9091,
})
```

For Android devices or emulators, reverse the port before launching the app:

```bash
adb reverse tcp:9091 tcp:9091
```

Build a local macOS app bundle:

```bash
npm run package:macos
```

The generated app is written to `dist/macos/ReactNativeKit.app` and includes the backend, the required Reactotron runtime files, and a bundled Bun runtime.

## MCP usage

ReactNativeKit starts its MCP server automatically with the desktop app. The default MCP endpoint is:

```txt
http://127.0.0.1:4567/mcp
```

Register it in Codex as `reactkit`. After it is available in a Codex session, use the ReactNativeKit MCP tools to inspect runtime data without calling the HTTP endpoint directly.

Common MCP queries:

```json
{
  "tool": "query_logs",
  "arguments": {
    "prefix": "specialPlans",
    "subprefix": "sync",
    "limit": 20
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "tool": "query_network",
  "arguments": {
    "url": "aiv-vip-plans",
    "limit": 20
  }
}
```

Useful tools exposed by the MCP server include:

- `query_logs`: read filtered timeline logs by prefix, subprefix, keyword, and time range.
- `query_network`: read filtered API/network events by URL, method, headers, and time range.
- `query_storage`: inspect AsyncStorage mutation events.
- `request_state` and `request_state_keys`: inspect Redux or MST state when the app plugin is configured.
- `clear_timeline`: clear timeline events from the desktop app and MCP buffer.

If Codex does not show the ReactNativeKit MCP tools after changing the MCP configuration, restart the Codex session so the tool list refreshes.

## Codex skill usage

Use the `rnkit` Codex skill when you want Codex to diagnose runtime evidence from the local ReactNativeKit desktop app. The skill queries the local API at `http://127.0.0.1:3901`, so ReactNativeKit must be running first.

Example prompts:

```txt
Use $rnkit to inspect connected apps.
```

```txt
Use $rnkit to find recent logs with prefix PreviewGateTiming and subprefix finalGatePass.
```

```txt
Use $rnkit to inspect network responses whose URL contains aiv-vip-plans.
```

The skill workflow is:

1. Check ReactNativeKit status.
2. List connected apps when more than one app may be attached.
3. Query the narrowest useful data: logs by prefix/subprefix/keyword, or network events by URL/method/header.
4. Summarize evidence with timestamps and relevant values.

Prefer the skill for agent-led debugging sessions. Prefer MCP when another MCP-aware tool needs direct access to the ReactNativeKit tool surface.
